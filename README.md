# Basic Python Astrodynamics

## Summary

This repo contains my python programs I created while learning the basics of Astrodynamics.
Many of the programs were converted and tested against other programs in different languages 
from textbooks or other sources. I have since moved to more performant programming langauges 
for higher fidelity astrodynamic simulation. Python serves as a great tool to quickly test 
ideas and do low fidelity and computationally inexpensive simulation. This repo is meant to serve
as a starting point and reference for creating your own astrodynamics programs.
