# Basic Python Astrodynamics

## Summary

This repo contains my python programs I created while learning the basics of Astrodynamics.
Many of the programs were converted and tested against other programs in different languages 
from textbooks or other sources. All programs here are my own work. I have since moved onto
more preformant programming langauges for higher fidelity astrodynamic simulation. Python
serves as a great tool to quickly test ideas and do low fidelity simulation.
